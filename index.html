         <p class="First_para text" style="margin-left: -18px;">Shivaji Shahaji Bhosale (February 19, 1630 – April 3, 1680), popularly known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian king and the founder of the Maratha Empire.[1] Shivaraya carved out his own independent kingdom from the decaying Adilshahi of Bijapur and founded the Maratha Empire. A.D. He was formally enthroned as Chhatrapati in 1674 at Raigad Fort <br>
           <br>During his reign, Shivaji Maharaj had both alliances and enmity with the Mughal Empire, the Qutub Shahi of Gowalkonda, the Adil Shahi of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj built a powerful and progressive state on the strength of a disciplined army and a well-organized administrative system. Besides repairing the forts in the coastal and interior regions, he also built many new forts. Shivarai established a competent and progressive civil government with disciplined administrative organizations. He revived the ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions. <br><br>
         With his excellent knowledge of the terrain, amazing speed of movement and the technique of guerilla poetry, he successfully fought the mighty Mughal and Adil Shahi forces with a small force. He encouraged the use of Marathi and Sanskrit instead of Parsi, which was the prevailing language of the time, in governance. During the Indian freedom struggle, nationalist leaders used Shivaji Maharaj's heroic stories to rally people and boost their morale. <br><br>Shivaji Maharaj's legacy varied with observers and time. But nearly two centuries after his death, he began to gain more prominence with the rise of the Indian independence movement as many Indian freedom fighters considered him a proto-nationalist and Hindu hero. Shivaji Maharaj has a great influence in the social and political history of Maharashtra. Shivaji Maharaj is an integral part of the Marathi people's identity.[6] Shivaji Maharaj's birthday is celebrated as Shiv Jayanti.[7]</p> 
        
           
           
           <p class="subheads">Early life </p>
           
           <p class="Second text">Shivneri hill fort located near Junnar city in Pune district on February 19 AD. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born in 1630. [8] Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's exact date of birth is a matter of disagreement among historians. The Maharashtra State Government accepted Phalgun Vadya Tritiya Shaka 1551 (Friday, February 19, 1630) as Shiva Raya's birth date in 2001. Other possible dates include 6 April 1627 (Vaisakh Shuddha Tritiya).[10] The Government of Maharashtra has listed 19 February as a holiday to commemorate the birth of Shivaji Maharaj (Shivaji Jayanti). <br><br>Shivaji Maharaj was named after the god Shivai. [19] [20] According to a legend, the son was named 'Shivaji' after Jijabai prayed to the Shivai Devi at Shivneri Fort to give him a strong son. [21] Shivarai's father Shahajiraje Bhonsale was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanate. [22] His mother was Jijabai, daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindkhed. The Jadhavs belonged to the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri. <br><br> At the time of Shivaji Maharaj's birth, the kingdom in the Deccan was divided into three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, Ahmednagar and Gowalkonda. Shahajiraj shifted his allegiance from time to time between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshahi of Bijapur and the Mughals; But he always kept Pune as his capital and maintained a small army of his own  <br><br>Ch. Shivaji Maharaj belonged to the Maratha caste and belonged to the Bhosale clan. [27] His grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an influential general of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and was given the title "Raja". He was given Deshmukh rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given Fort Shivneri for the residence of his family  <br></p>


           <p class="subheads">Conflict with the Bijapur Sultanate</p> 

           <p class="Second text">A.D. In 1646, the 16-year-old Shiva Raya took advantage of the turmoil in the Bijapur court caused by the Sultan's illness,[37] and took possession of the great treasure found there. [38] [39] Over the next two years Shiva Raya captured several important forts near Pune. These include Purandhar, Kondhana and Chakan. Also they directly captured the places of Supe, Baramati and Indapur. He conquered the hill of Murumbadev in front of Torangad and repaired it and named it Rajgad.[40]. <br><br>After this Shivaji Maharaj turned towards Konkan and captured the important city of Kalyan. The Bijapur government decided to take action after taking notice of these incidents. On 25 July 1648, a fellow Maratha warlord named Baji Ghorpade captured Shahaji Raja on the orders of the Bijapur government in an attempt to capture Shivaji Maharaj. <br><br> After capturing Jinji in 1649, Shahaji Raja was released after gaining the position of Adilshah in Karnataka. Between 1649 - 1655 Shivaraya paused in his conquests and quietly consolidated his gains. [19] After his father's release, Shivaji Maharaj resumed raids and in 1656, in controversial circumstances, killed Chandrarao More, a fellow Maratha feudal lord of Bijapur, and seized from him the Jawli Valley near the present-day hill station of Mahabaleshwar. Apart from the Bhosale and More families, many others served the Adilshahi of Bijapur, including the Sawants of Sawantwadi, Ghorpades of Mudhol, Nimbalkars of Phaltan, Shirkes, Manes and Mohites, many of whom served in a Deshmukhi Hakka. To subdue these powerful families, Shivarai adopted various tactics such as creating matrimonial alliances, dealing directly with the village Patlas to outwit the Deshmukhs, or fighting them. Shahaji Raja in his later years was ambivalent towards his son and disapproved of his rebellious activities. [45] He asked the Bijapuris to do whatever they wanted with Shivaji. Shahaji Raja died in a hunting accident in 1664 - 1665. <br></p>
            
            
           <p class="subheads"> Fight with Afzal Khan</p>

           <p class="Second text big">The Bijapur Sultanate was displeased with the losses inflicted by Shivaji Maharaj. After the peace treaty with the Mughals and the general acceptance of the young Ali Adil Shah as the second Sultan, the government of Bijapur became more stable and turned its attention to Shivaji Maharaj. [46] In 1657 the Sultan, or more likely his mother and governess, sent Afzal Khan, a veteran general, to arrest Shivaji Maharaj.Before advancing towards Shivaji Maharaj, the Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhawani temple, which was the holy place of Shivaji Maharaj's family, and the Vitthal temple at Pandharpur, a major pilgrimage site for Hindus. <br><br>After being chased by the Bijapuri army, Shivaji Maharaj went to the Pratapgarh fort, where many of his colleagues pressured him to surrender. [50] When Afzal Khan Y approached, Shivaji decided to face him from Pratapgad near present-day Mahabaleshwar. <br><br> Both the armies blocked each other. While Shivaji Maharaj could not break the siege, Afzal Khan lacked the means of siege despite having a powerful cavalry. So he too was unable to take the fort. Two months later, Afzal Khan sent an emissary to Shivaji Maharaj to negotiate a private meeting outside the fort. [51] [52] Treaty negotiations began and Afzal Khan insisted that Shivaji Maharaj himself come for the final negotiations.But Shivajiraj's lawyer (Pantaji Gopinath Bokil) called Afzal Khan to meet him at Pratapgad itself. <br> <br>    On November 10, 1659, both of them met in a camp at the foot of Pratapgarh fort. It was decided that each person should come armed with only one sword and only one follower should be present
        <br><br>Shivaji Maharaj suspected that Afzal Khan would arrest or even attack him. [54] A decade earlier, Khan had imprisoned a Hindu chieftain during one such visit. So, as a precaution, they put on armor and kept with them bichawa and tiger claws. The bichwa was hidden in the armor while the tiger claw on the left hand was hidden inside the claw of the hand.[55] Along with this, he carried a dagger in the right hand. Jiva Mahala was a trusted Sardar with Shivaji Maharaj, while Syed Banda was a famous tyrant with Afzal Khan. During the visit, Baldand Afzal Khan of Unchapura embraced Shivaji Maharaj and Shivaji Raj's life came to an end. At the same time, Afzal Khan attacked Shivaji Maharaj with a dagger but Shivaji Raj was saved due to his armor. Seeing Afzal Khan's treachery, Shivaji Raja inserted the tiger into Khan's stomach.At the same time Afzal Khan's death cry spread towards Chahu. The Bada Syed instantly struck Shivaji with a heavy blow of the strap which the quick Jiva Mahal caught on himself and saved Shivajiraj's life. This is the reason why the saying "Hota Jiwa Kei Vachla Shiva" came into vogue. <br><br>As a pre-arranged warning, three cannon were fired from Pratapgarh at the meeting, and the Mawlas, who were hiding in the bushes near the Khan's camp, attacked the Khan's army. [59] Fazal Khan, the Khan's son, and some other chieftains came up to the main camp of Laptalpat Wai. Here there was a janana of food. They left treasure, elephants and other heavy goods and fled to Bijapur to escape from Netaji's pursuing army. <br><br>After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji Raja sent a warlord named Doroji to conquer more forts and territories in Konkanpatta. Shivaraya himself went to Kolhapur and conquered Panhala. In modern times, this day of Afzal Khan's death is celebrated as Shiv Pratap Day.</p>
