         <p class="First_para text" style="margin-left: -18px;">Shivaji Shahaji Bhosale (February 19, 1630 – April 3, 1680), popularly known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian king and the founder of the Maratha Empire.[1] Shivaraya carved out his own independent kingdom from the decaying Adilshahi of Bijapur and founded the Maratha Empire. A.D. He was formally enthroned as Chhatrapati in 1674 at Raigad Fort <br>
           <br>During his reign, Shivaji Maharaj had both alliances and enmity with the Mughal Empire, the Qutub Shahi of Gowalkonda, the Adil Shahi of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj built a powerful and progressive state on the strength of a disciplined army and a well-organized administrative system. Besides repairing the forts in the coastal and interior regions, he also built many new forts. Shivarai established a competent and progressive civil government with disciplined administrative organizations. He revived the ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions. <br><br>
         With his excellent knowledge of the terrain, amazing speed of movement and the technique of guerilla poetry, he successfully fought the mighty Mughal and Adil Shahi forces with a small force. He encouraged the use of Marathi and Sanskrit instead of Parsi, which was the prevailing language of the time, in governance. During the Indian freedom struggle, nationalist leaders used Shivaji Maharaj's heroic stories to rally people and boost their morale. <br><br>Shivaji Maharaj's legacy varied with observers and time. But nearly two centuries after his death, he began to gain more prominence with the rise of the Indian independence movement as many Indian freedom fighters considered him a proto-nationalist and Hindu hero. Shivaji Maharaj has a great influence in the social and political history of Maharashtra. Shivaji Maharaj is an integral part of the Marathi people's identity.[6] Shivaji Maharaj's birthday is celebrated as Shiv Jayanti.[7]</p> 
        
           
           
           <p class="subheads">Early life </p>
           
           <p class="Second text">Shivneri hill fort located near Junnar city in Pune district on February 19 AD. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born in 1630. [8] Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's exact date of birth is a matter of disagreement among historians. The Maharashtra State Government accepted Phalgun Vadya Tritiya Shaka 1551 (Friday, February 19, 1630) as Shiva Raya's birth date in 2001. Other possible dates include 6 April 1627 (Vaisakh Shuddha Tritiya).[10] The Government of Maharashtra has listed 19 February as a holiday to commemorate the birth of Shivaji Maharaj (Shivaji Jayanti). <br><br>Shivaji Maharaj was named after the god Shivai. [19] [20] According to a legend, the son was named 'Shivaji' after Jijabai prayed to the Shivai Devi at Shivneri Fort to give him a strong son. [21] Shivarai's father Shahajiraje Bhonsale was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanate. [22] His mother was Jijabai, daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindkhed. The Jadhavs belonged to the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri. <br><br> At the time of Shivaji Maharaj's birth, the kingdom in the Deccan was divided into three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, Ahmednagar and Gowalkonda. Shahajiraj shifted his allegiance from time to time between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshahi of Bijapur and the Mughals; But he always kept Pune as his capital and maintained a small army of his own  <br><br>Ch. Shivaji Maharaj belonged to the Maratha caste and belonged to the Bhosale clan. [27] His grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an influential general of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and was given the title "Raja". He was given Deshmukh rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given Fort Shivneri for the residence of his family  <br></p>


           <p class="subheads">Conflict with the Bijapur Sultanate</p> 

           <p class="Second text">A.D. In 1646, the 16-year-old Shiva Raya took advantage of the turmoil in the Bijapur court caused by the Sultan's illness,[37] and took possession of the great treasure found there. [38] [39] Over the next two years Shiva Raya captured several important forts near Pune. These include Purandhar, Kondhana and Chakan. Also they directly captured the places of Supe, Baramati and Indapur. He conquered the hill of Murumbadev in front of Torangad and repaired it and named it Rajgad.[40]. <br><br>After this Shivaji Maharaj turned towards Konkan and captured the important city of Kalyan. The Bijapur government decided to take action after taking notice of these incidents. On 25 July 1648, a fellow Maratha warlord named Baji Ghorpade captured Shahaji Raja on the orders of the Bijapur government in an attempt to capture Shivaji Maharaj. <br><br> After capturing Jinji in 1649, Shahaji Raja was released after gaining the position of Adilshah in Karnataka. Between 1649 - 1655 Shivaraya paused in his conquests and quietly consolidated his gains. [19] After his father's release, Shivaji Maharaj resumed raids and in 1656, in controversial circumstances, killed Chandrarao More, a fellow Maratha feudal lord of Bijapur, and seized from him the Jawli Valley near the present-day hill station of Mahabaleshwar. Apart from the Bhosale and More families, many others served the Adilshahi of Bijapur, including the Sawants of Sawantwadi, Ghorpades of Mudhol, Nimbalkars of Phaltan, Shirkes, Manes and Mohites, many of whom served in a Deshmukhi Hakka. To subdue these powerful families, Shivarai adopted various tactics such as creating matrimonial alliances, dealing directly with the village Patlas to outwit the Deshmukhs, or fighting them. Shahaji Raja in his later years was ambivalent towards his son and disapproved of his rebellious activities. [45] He asked the Bijapuris to do whatever they wanted with Shivaji. Shahaji Raja died in a hunting accident in 1664 - 1665. <br></p>
            
            
           <p class="subheads"> Fight with Afzal Khan</p>

           <p class="Second text big">The Bijapur Sultanate was displeased with the losses inflicted by Shivaji Maharaj. After the peace treaty with the Mughals and the general acceptance of the young Ali Adil Shah as the second Sultan, the government of Bijapur became more stable and turned its attention to Shivaji Maharaj. [46] In 1657 the Sultan, or more likely his mother and governess, sent Afzal Khan, a veteran general, to arrest Shivaji Maharaj.Before advancing towards Shivaji Maharaj, the Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhawani temple, which was the holy place of Shivaji Maharaj's family, and the Vitthal temple at Pandharpur, a major pilgrimage site for Hindus. <br><br>After being chased by the Bijapuri army, Shivaji Maharaj went to the Pratapgarh fort, where many of his colleagues pressured him to surrender. [50] When Afzal Khan Y approached, Shivaji decided to face him from Pratapgad near present-day Mahabaleshwar. <br><br> Both the armies blocked each other. While Shivaji Maharaj could not break the siege, Afzal Khan lacked the means of siege despite having a powerful cavalry. So he too was unable to take the fort. Two months later, Afzal Khan sent an emissary to Shivaji Maharaj to negotiate a private meeting outside the fort. [51] [52] Treaty negotiations began and Afzal Khan insisted that Shivaji Maharaj himself come for the final negotiations.But Shivajiraj's lawyer (Pantaji Gopinath Bokil) called Afzal Khan to meet him at Pratapgad itself. <br> <br>    On November 10, 1659, both of them met in a camp at the foot of Pratapgarh fort. It was decided that each person should come armed with only one sword and only one follower should be present
        <br><br>Shivaji Maharaj suspected that Afzal Khan would arrest or even attack him. [54] A decade earlier, Khan had imprisoned a Hindu chieftain during one such visit. So, as a precaution, they put on armor and kept with them bichawa and tiger claws. The bichwa was hidden in the armor while the tiger claw on the left hand was hidden inside the claw of the hand.[55] Along with this, he carried a dagger in the right hand. Jiva Mahala was a trusted Sardar with Shivaji Maharaj, while Syed Banda was a famous tyrant with Afzal Khan. During the visit, Baldand Afzal Khan of Unchapura embraced Shivaji Maharaj and Shivaji Raj's life came to an end. At the same time, Afzal Khan attacked Shivaji Maharaj with a dagger but Shivaji Raj was saved due to his armor. Seeing Afzal Khan's treachery, Shivaji Raja inserted the tiger into Khan's stomach.At the same time Afzal Khan's death cry spread towards Chahu. The Bada Syed instantly struck Shivaji with a heavy blow of the strap which the quick Jiva Mahal caught on himself and saved Shivajiraj's life. This is the reason why the saying "Hota Jiwa Kei Vachla Shiva" came into vogue. <br><br>As a pre-arranged warning, three cannon were fired from Pratapgarh at the meeting, and the Mawlas, who were hiding in the bushes near the Khan's camp, attacked the Khan's army. [59] Fazal Khan, the Khan's son, and some other chieftains came up to the main camp of Laptalpat Wai. Here there was a janana of food. They left treasure, elephants and other heavy goods and fled to Bijapur to escape from Netaji's pursuing army. <br><br>After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji Raja sent a warlord named Doroji to conquer more forts and territories in Konkanpatta. Shivaraya himself went to Kolhapur and conquered Panhala. In modern times, this day of Afzal Khan's death is celebrated as Shiv Pratap Day.</p>


        <p class="subheads">Battle of Pawankhindi</p> 

               <p class="Second text big_1">The Battle of Pawankhindi is considered to be one of the most important battles in Marathi history. This battle took place on 13 July 1660 at Pawankhind or Ghodhkhind near Vishalgad. After escaping the siege of Panhala, Shivaji Maharaj was marching towards Vishalgarh. The Adilshahi army got his clue and the Adilshahi army started chasing after Shivaji Maharaj.    When Maharaj and his companions reached Ghodkhindi, Baji Prabhu Deshpande ordered Maharaj without request that Shivaji Maharaj should proceed to the fort and if Maharaj did not reach the fort, Baji would fight this pass and stop the enemy there. Baji Prabhu pleaded with Maharaj that 'millions may die, but millions should live.' Such a battle is considered a last stand in warfare. The Adilshahi army was led by Siddi Johar. He was accompanied by Siddi Masood and Fazal Khan (son of Afzal Khan). Jauhar had a total force of 10,000 while the Maharaja had only 300 to 600 Mawlas. Maharaja came down from the fort on the full moon night, broke the siege and marched towards Vishalgad. Maharaja kept behind him a person named Shiva Kashid who looked like him. When Jauhar got a clue that Shivaji Maharaj had gone to Vishalgarh, he sent Siddi Masood on the trail of Maharaj and started chasing him. After some time, when Maharaj and his companions reached Ghodkhindi, they realized that Masud's soldiers in pursuit were close at hand, and it was anticipated that they would soon reach and capture the others with Maharaj. There was a very bumpy ride in the horse stall. Only one or two people will go through the queue at a time. Baji Prabhu explained the situation to Maharaja and requested him to leave for Vishalgarh. Shivaji Maharaj next proceeded to Vishalgarh. When Masud's soldiers reached the pass, they were confronted by a horizontal line of mawlis. The rear ranks of Mawls also climbed the surrounding ridges and started raining stones. The Marathas started slaughtering Masood's soldiers in such a way that only one or two soldiers could reach the Maratha line and were killed due to the narrow path.<br><br> Baji Prabhu, Phulaji, Sambhaji Jadhav, Bandal killed Masood's soldiers from their bows. Baji Prabhu's zeal has blown the filter of many people. Masud ordered the gunners to climb the ridge and open fire on Baji Prabhu. Baji was shot at. Even though Baji Prabhu was injured, he warned the soldiers not to leave their posts under any circumstances. In no time Shivaji Maharaj reached Vishalgarh. They sounded the alarm of the cannons. Here in Ghodkhindi, Baji Prabhu gave up his life with the satisfaction of fulfilling his duty only after hearing the alarm of the guns. Almost all the 300 Marathas were defeated, while Masud suffered heavy losses. Nearly 3000 soldiers were killed. Ghodkhindi got its name as Pawankhind as this place was purified due to the sacrifice of Baji Prabhu and other Maratha soldiers. <br></p>


               <p class="subheads">Surat's first loot</p> 

               <p class="Second text" >A.D. 1664. Shivaji was worried because of the constant wars and the emptying of the treasury. This did not bother the Mughals or other sultans much. The monarchy did not hesitate to levy unjust taxes or extort extortion from the people. After many days of turmoil, Shivaji Raja finally found a solution which was the first loot of Surat known to history. The city of Surat in today's Gujarat state was in the then Mughal Empire and was considered one of the richest cities due to trade.The looting of the city of Surat achieved two things, one was a challenge to Mughal power and an addition to the state treasury.[85]<br>
 <br>
                The history of looting in India is very bloody and destructive. Against that background, the loot of Surat feels completely different. Women, children and the elderly were looted without even touching their hair as ordered by Shivaji Raja. <br>
                  <br>
              
                Although the Mughals had provided 5,000 soldiers for the defense of Surat, it was obvious that it was impossible for the enemy to march on Surat in view of the overall situation at that time. The sea lanes in the Gulf of Khambhayat were dominated by English, Dutch and Portuguese armadas, in the north, and for hundreds of km in the east by the Mughals. In the south, Shaiste Khan had just come with a large army to defeat the Marathas and other Shahyas. In such a situation, Subhedar Inayat Khan had reduced the Kumak in Surat. Surat, which had 5,000 soldiers on paper, actually had around 1,000 fighting soldiers. Bahirji Naik and his spy agency also tracked this and advised Shivaji Maharaj that an attack would be successful before Shibandi re-increased. <br><br>It was imperative for the Marathas to gather as much wealth as possible in the shortest possible time and spread out of Surat before Kumk arrived from other Mughal strongholds. Finally, taking the abundant treasure collected, the Marathas left Surat on 10th January. Marathas came back to Khandesh through the Tapi Valley and from there to Rajgad, giving way to the Mughal units in the rear.

              <p class="subheads">Coronation (राज्याभिषेक )</p> 

               <p class="Second text big_2">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj crowned himself on Jyeshtha Shuddha Trayodashi Shalivahana Shaka 1596 i.e. 6th June 1674 and proclaimed a sovereign state. The ceremony of Navchaitanya was held in the Marathi region, which had been under slavery for many years. The coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was a very widespread and a very important event in the history of India . Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj assumed the title of Chhatrapati during his coronation. Chhatrapati means sovereign and all-powerful. An Ashtapradhan Mandal was formed for the administration of the state and the administration and posts of the state were distributed. During the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Soyrabai was anointed as Maharani and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje Maharaj as Crown Prince.<br><br>Preparations for the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivajiraje Bhosale had started many months before. There was no set tradition for coronation. Some scholars have studied customs and traditions through texts on ancient traditions and politics. Brahmins from all corners of the country were invited for the coronation of Shiva. Around one lakh people had gathered at Raigad . For four months their accommodation was well arranged. They had dessert every day. Rich dignitaries of the Sardar state, representatives of other states, foreign businessmen and common people all attended this function. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was absorbed in a religious ritual and ritual every day. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj first saluted his mother Jijabai . His blessings were taken.

                <br><br> After that, Maharaj went to various temples and visited God. Devake visited, performed pooja and returned to Raigad on 12 May 1674. He could not go to Tuljapur to see Bhawani Mata. So after four days he went to see Bhavanimata Devi installed at Pratapgad . At that time, a gold umbrella of half a maund was offered to Bhavani Mata. On 21 May, he again engaged in religious rituals at Ragyagad. Maharaja did penance on 28th. Janeway wore. The next day, the marriage ceremony was performed again with the two queens. At that time 7000 was given to Gagabhatta and 17000 to all other Brahmins.

                <br><br>
              
                On the next day Maharaja was weighed with seven metals like gold , silver , copper , zinc , tin , lead and iron . Apart from this , clothes , camphor , salt , nails , spices , butter , jaggery, fruits etc. were weighed.

                <br><br>

                The coronation hall was decorated with 32 omen symbols as per Hindu tradition. According to Bhasbad Bakhar , the grand throne of 32 manas of gold (valued at Rs. 14 lakhs) was covered with gold leaf. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ascended the throne. Sixteen Savashnis waved them off. Brahmins chanted mantras loudly. Prajeni blessed Maharaj. 'Shivaraj Ki Jai', 'Shivaraj Ki Jai' slogans were given. Gold and silver flowers were scattered. The sky was filled with the shouts of various percussionists. Guns were fired from each fort as planned. The chief priest Gagabhatta came forward and placed a pearl fringe on the king's head and pronounced 'Shivachhatrapati'. King Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj gifted a lot of money to all the people. He performed sixteen types of Mahadan in total . After that various ministers went before the throne and greeted the king . Chhatrapati presented him with various posts, appointment letters, money , horses , elephants , gems , clothes , weapons on this occasion. It was all over by eight o'clock in the morning. After the ceremony, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj first rode a handsome horse towards the temple of Jagadishwara . From there, riding on an elephant, his procession left for Raigad. On the other two elephants were army representatives carrying jaripatka and saffron flags. Ashtapradhan and other troops were with him. While this procession was passing through Raigad, the common people waved flowers, crushed, scattered and waved lamps. Maharaj returned to the palace after visiting various temples at Raigad .

                <b>Ashtapradhana Mandal <br>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                </b>At the time of coronation, Shivaji Maharaj gave Sanskrit names to the ministers in the Ashtapradhan Mandal and these posts were decided on the merit of the ministers rather than lineage. The Ashtapradhan Mandal after the coronation was as follows.  <br><br>

              <p class="subheads">Second Coronation  </p> 

               <p class="Second text">Shivaji Maharaj's mother Jijabai passed away on 18 June 1674. The Marathas called Nischal Puri Goswami, a Tantric priest, who declared that the original coronation had taken place under inauspicious stars and that a second coronation was necessary. This second coronation, which took place on 24 September 1674, served a double purpose; who still believed that Shivaji was not eligible for the Vedic rites of his first coronation, so he was crowned with a less-contested additional ceremony. <br><br>After the Abhishek performed by Gagabhatta, Shivaji Maharaj performed his second coronation on Puranokta or Tantric method on Ashwin Shuddha Panchami (24th September 1674) according to contemporary Sanskrit texts called 'Shivarajyabhishek Kalpataru'. [137] Poet Aniruddha Saraswati wrote this book and it contains a dialogue between two persons, Nishchalpuri Gosavi and Govind. It said that "there were many blunders in the Abhishek performed by Gagabhatta and the Maharaja is suffering the adverse consequences." [138] It mentions the death of General Prataprao Gujar, the lightning strike at Pratapgarh, the death of the Maharaja's wife Kashibai, and the death of Queen Mother Jijabai only twelve days after the coronation. From this it can be concluded that there must have been some misunderstandings about the Vedic method of coronation among the priests of that time. In particular, the priests advocating the Tantramarga may have considered Tantric rituals superior to the Vedic rituals and therefore the priests advocating the Tantramarga may have urged Shivaji Maharaj to undergo Puranic or Tantric Abhishek. [138] Whatever the reason, on 24 September 1674 Shivaji Maharaj's second coronation took place technically. The coronation ceremony was conducted in a very simple manner. There is no mention of this second coronation by Western historians or many chroniclers of the time. [139]</p>

                <p class="subheads">Governance</p> 

               <p class="Second text big_1"><b>Ashtapradhan Mandal : </b>Shivaji Maharaj had appointed Ashtapradhan Mandal consisting of eight ministers for governance. This minister advised the king on matters of governance.<br><br> <b>Promotion and development of Marathi and Sanskrit languages : </b> During Shiva Raya's reign, Parsi language was widely used in governance. But Shivaraya made important changes in this. Shivarai appointed a committee of his officers. The committee was tasked with suggesting Sanskrit words that could be used instead of Parsi and Arabic words. In 1677, this committee introduced a dictionary named 'Rajyavyasavyakosh'. Shiva's royal seal was also in Sanskrit. <br> <br> <b>Religious Policy : </b> Shivaji Maharaj ruled with a secular and tolerant attitude. He believed in harmony among different religions. When Aurangzeb started levying the jizya tax, Shivaraya wrote a letter demanding the abolition of the jizya tax and advising Aurangzeb to treat the faiths and domains of Hinduism with respect, as Akbar had done. His army consisted of Muslims from the beginning. In 1656, the first batch of Pathans was formed. Darya Sarang, the naval commander of Shiva Raya was a Muslim[86]. Sant Ramdas was considered Shiva Raya's mentor, but recent research has revealed that Sant Ramdas met Shiva Raya later in his career. <br><br> <b>Rajmudra :</b> Rajamudra Chhatrapati Shivaji Raja, when he took charge of Pune, created his own independent Rajmudra. The mudras of Shahaji Raje and Jijabai were in Parsi language, but Shivaji Maharaj used Sanskrit language for the royal mudra. The text on this royal mudra is as follows. <br><br> "प्रतिपच्चंद्रलेखेव वर्धिष्णुर्विश्ववंदिता शाहसुनोः शिवस्यैषा मुद्रा भद्राय राजते".  ज्याप्रमाणे प्रतिपदेचा चंद्र वाढत जातो आणि साऱ्या विश्वात वंदनीय होतो, तशीच शहाजींचा पुत्र शिवाजींची ही मुद्रा व तिचा लौकिक वाढत जाईल असा याचा अर्थ होतो."

               <p class="subheads"> Death and Succession </p> 

               <p class="Second text">The question of Shivajiraj's heir was complicated. In 1678 Shiva Raya imprisoned Sambhaji Raja at Panhala . After that Sambhaji Raje along with his wife went to the Mughals for a year . Later he returned home unrepentant and was again confined to Panhala. [146]

                <br><br>[147] Shivaji Maharaj died at the age of 50 on 3–5 April 1680, on the eve of Hanuman Jayanti . The cause of his death is disputed. British records state that he died after an illness of 12 days. [d] A contemporary document from the Portuguese-language Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa gives the cause of death as anthrax. [149] [150] <br><br>However, Krishnaji Anant Bhasbad , the author of Bhasbad Bakhar, a biography of Shivaji Raja , states that the cause of death was fever . Putalabai , the childless and youngest of Shivaji's surviving wives, committed sati by jumping into his funeral . The second surviving spouse, Sakwarbai , was not allowed to perform sati because she had a young daughter. <br><br>After Shivajiraj's death, Soyarabai along with various ministers planned to crown her son Rajaram instead of her stepson Sambhaji. On April 21, 1680, the ten-year-old Rajaram was enthroned. However, after killing the general, Sambhaji Raja captured Rayagada on 18 June and formally ascended the throne on 20 July. [84] Rajaram , his wife Jankibai and mother Soyrabai were imprisoned. [152]

              <p class="subheads ">Expansion of the Maratha Empire after Shivaji Maharaj
              </p> 

               <p class="Second text big_1">After Shivaji Maharaj, the Marathas continued to fight with the Mughals. After his death, in 1681, Aurangzeb launched an invasion of the south to capture the Maratha-held territories, the Adil Shahi at Bijapur and the Qutub Shahi at Gowalkonda . He succeeded in destroying both these sultanates but despite spending 27 years in the Deccan, he could not subdue the Marathas. During this period in 1689, Sambhaji Raja was captured by the Mughals and tortured and executed . The Marathas then put up a strong resistance under the leadership of Sambhajiraja's successor Rajaram and later Rajaram Maharaj's widow Tarabai . Due to battles, the territory was frequently exchanged between the Mughals and the Marathas. Later, in 1707, the conflict ended with the defeat of the Mughals. [163]

                <br><br>Shahu Maharaj , who was the grandson of Shivaji Maharaj and the son of Sambhaji Raja, was held captive by Aurangzeb during the 27-year conflict. After the death of Sambhaji Raja, his heirs rescued Shahuraj. After a brief power struggle with his aunt Tarabai for succession, Shahuraj ruled the Maratha Empire from 1707 to 1749. Early in his reign, he appointed Balaji Vishwanath and later his descendants as Peshwas ( Prime Ministers ) of the Maratha Empire. The Maratha Empire expanded greatly under Balaji's son, Peshwa Bajirao I, and grandson, Peshwa Balaji Bajirao . At the height of its success, the Maratha Empire extended from Tamil Nadu [164] in the south to Peshawar (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) in the north and Bengal in the east. In 1761, Maratha forces lost the Third Battle of Panipat to Ahmad Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani Empire , halting their imperial expansion into northwest India. Ten years after Panipat, the Marathas regained influence in northern India under Madhavrao Peshwa . <br><br>In an effort to effectively manage a large empire, Shahuraja and the Peshwas granted semi-autonomy to the strongest knights and created the Maratha League. [166] They came to be known as Gaikwad of Baroda , Holkar of Indore and Malwa , Sindhia of Gwalior and Bhonsale of Nagpur . In 1775, the East India Company intervened in the succession conflict at Pune , which resulted in the First Anglo-Maratha War . The Marathas remained the preeminent power in India until the defeat of the Marathas by the British in the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha Wars (1805-1818). But after these wars the company gained dominance in most parts of India.

              <p class="subheads">Shiva Jayanti</p> 

               <p class="Second text big" >Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti or Shiva Jayanti is a famous festival and celebration in Maharashtra . This festival is celebrated all over Maharashtra on February 19 as fixed by the Maharashtra government on the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the Maratha Empire . This day is a public holiday in Maharashtra . [1] This festival is also celebrated on a small scale in some places outside Maharashtra. <br><br>
                <b> History</b>
                Beginning of Shiva Jayanti: In 1869, Mahatma Phule discovered Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's mausoleum at Raigad and wrote the first long poem on his life. Jyotiba had applied that the government should take over the arrangement of Shivaji Maharaj's mausoleum at Raigad. In 1870, Mahatma Phule celebrated the first "Shiva Jayanti" in Pune. Then in 1895, Lokmanya Tilak started Shiv Jayanti celebrations. The intention behind this was that the people should come together on the occasion of such festivals to arouse patriotism and use it to fight against the British. In the early days, Shiv Jayanti was celebrated only in Maharashtra. But in the first decade of the 20th century, the festival of Shiva Jayanti reached Bengal.


                  <br> <br>
              
                  The credit of starting Shiv Jayanti in Bengal goes to 'Sakharam Ganesh Deoskar' (1869-1912). He was a follower of Lokmanya Tilak, in 1902 he celebrated Shiva Jayanti in Bengal. Deuskar was a Maharashtrian by birth but settled in Bengal. Later in 1905, when Lord Curzon proposed the partition of Bengal, this festival became more popular. The festival helped a lot in creating public opinion against the British under Shiva Raya's inspiration. It also helped a lot in creating harmony in the two states of Maharashtra and Bengal.

                  <br><br>IRabindranath Tagore also praised Shivaji Maharaj by writing a poem called 'Shivaji Utsav' at that time. In that poem of his he says - O Shivaji Raja, when the thought of making this country independent arose in your mind, my country remained silent. But the mantra of independence given by you will always shine in our minds.

                  <br><br>
                  Lokmanya Tilak initiated the celebration of Shiv Jayanti and started celebrating Shiv Jayanti vigorously in entire Maharashtra. It was necessary for the youth to unite against the British and to become nationalistic, for which Tilak celebrated Shiv Jayanti every year with great fanfare, a tradition that continues even today. In the 20th century, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar also celebrated Shiv Jayanti, he presided over the Shiv Jayanti program twice. Since then, Shiv Jayanti began to be celebrated on a large scale. On 3rd May 1927 at Badlapur near Mumbai , Dr. Shiv Jayanti Utsav. It was celebrated under the presidency of Babasaheb Ambedkar.  <br><br>The villagers of Badlapur had invited Babasaheb Ambedkar for the program without caste discrimination. According to the information printed in the 20th May 1927 issue of Bahishkrit Bharat, Babasaheb Ambedkar gave a speech on Shivaji Maharaj's philanthropic polity. At the time of kirtana, touchables and untouchables sat together and listened to kirtan . At night Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's palanquin under the leadership of Babasaheb Ambedkar with about fifteen thousand people circumambulated the city and the festival came to an end.
