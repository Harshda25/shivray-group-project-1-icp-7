         <p class="First_para text" style="margin-left: -18px;">Shivaji Shahaji Bhosale (February 19, 1630 – April 3, 1680), popularly known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian king and the founder of the Maratha Empire.[1] Shivaraya carved out his own independent kingdom from the decaying Adilshahi of Bijapur and founded the Maratha Empire. A.D. He was formally enthroned as Chhatrapati in 1674 at Raigad Fort <br>
           <br>During his reign, Shivaji Maharaj had both alliances and enmity with the Mughal Empire, the Qutub Shahi of Gowalkonda, the Adil Shahi of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj built a powerful and progressive state on the strength of a disciplined army and a well-organized administrative system. Besides repairing the forts in the coastal and interior regions, he also built many new forts. Shivarai established a competent and progressive civil government with disciplined administrative organizations. He revived the ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions. <br><br>
         With his excellent knowledge of the terrain, amazing speed of movement and the technique of guerilla poetry, he successfully fought the mighty Mughal and Adil Shahi forces with a small force. He encouraged the use of Marathi and Sanskrit instead of Parsi, which was the prevailing language of the time, in governance. During the Indian freedom struggle, nationalist leaders used Shivaji Maharaj's heroic stories to rally people and boost their morale. <br><br>Shivaji Maharaj's legacy varied with observers and time. But nearly two centuries after his death, he began to gain more prominence with the rise of the Indian independence movement as many Indian freedom fighters considered him a proto-nationalist and Hindu hero. Shivaji Maharaj has a great influence in the social and political history of Maharashtra. Shivaji Maharaj is an integral part of the Marathi people's identity.[6] Shivaji Maharaj's birthday is celebrated as Shiv Jayanti.[7]</p>

           <p class="Second text">Shivneri hill fort located near Junnar city in Pune district on February 19 AD. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born in 1630. [8] Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's exact date of birth is a matter of disagreement among historians. The Maharashtra State Government accepted Phalgun Vadya Tritiya Shaka 1551 (Friday, February 19, 1630) as Shiva Raya's birth date in 2001. Other possible dates include 6 April 1627 (Vaisakh Shuddha Tritiya).[10] The Government of Maharashtra has listed 19 February as a holiday to commemorate the birth of Shivaji Maharaj (Shivaji Jayanti). <br><br>Shivaji Maharaj was named after the god Shivai. [19] [20] According to a legend, the son was named 'Shivaji' after Jijabai prayed to the Shivai Devi at Shivneri Fort to give him a strong son. [21] Shivarai's father Shahajiraje Bhonsale was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanate. [22] His mother was Jijabai, daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindkhed. The Jadhavs belonged to the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri. <br><br> At the time of Shivaji Maharaj's birth, the kingdom in the Deccan was divided into three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, Ahmednagar and Gowalkonda. Shahajiraj shifted his allegiance from time to time between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshahi of Bijapur and the Mughals; But he always kept Pune as his capital and maintained a small army of his own  <br><br>Ch. Shivaji Maharaj belonged to the Maratha caste and belonged to the Bhosale clan. [27] His grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an influential general of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and was given the title "Raja". He was given Deshmukh rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given Fort Shivneri for the residence of his family  <br></p>
