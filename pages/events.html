    <h1><u> CONQUEST OF TORANA</u></h1>
    <img class="b c" src="./../images/torana.jpg">
    <p class="a">

        It was the first fort captured by Shivaji as Chieftain of Marathas which led to the foundation of his ruling attributes of valour and determination at the age of 16.
         This conquest drives him to capture another like Raigarh and Pratapgarh.
          Due to these conquests, the Sultan of Bijapur was getting panic and he put Shahji, Shivaji's father in prison.
           In AD 1659, Shivaji again tried to attack Bijapur then the Sultan of Bijapur sent his general, Afzal Khan, to capture Shivaji. But Shivaji managed to escape and killed him with a deadly weapon called Baghnakh or the tiger's claw.
            Finally, in 1662, the Sultan of Bijapur made a peace treaty with Shivaji and made him an independent ruler of his conquered territories.

    <img class="b c" src="./../images/kondana.jpg">
    <p class="a">


      It was under the control of Nilkanth Rao.
       It was fought between Tanaji Malusare, a commander of Maratha ruler Shivaji and Udaybhan Rathod, fort keeper under Jai Singh I.
       Ultimately, the Marathas won due to Tanaji's bravery and hoisted the saffron flag on the Kondhana Fort. Despite the victory, Shivaji was deeply hurt by the loss of his most capable commander and friend and famously said – “Gad ala pan Sinha gela.” (“The fort has come, but the lion is gone.”).
       Despite the victory, Shivaji was deeply hurt by the loss of his most capable commander and friend and famously said – “Gad ala pan Sinha gela.” (“The fort has come, but the lion is gone.”). In the honour of Tanaji, he changed the name of the Kondhana Fort to Sinhagad Fort as he used to refer to Tanaji as 'Sinha' (Lion).

  <h1 class="d"><u> ALLIANCE WITH QUTUB SHAHI RULERS GOLCONDA </u></h1>
  <img   class="b " src="./../images/gol.jpg"  >

  <P class="a ">

    With the help of this alliance, he led the campaign into Bijapur Karanataka (AD 1676-79) and conquered Gingee (Jingi), Vellore and many forts in Karnataka.
    Hyderabad: Not many know that Chhatrapati Shivaji visited Golconda Fort to strike a military alliance with Qutub Shahi ruler Abul Hasan Tanashah in 1677 for a united fight against Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. The deal was signed, but for some reasons, it was not honoured.
The history of Hyderabad and its predecessor capital city, Golconda, would have taken an altogether different course had the deal been honoured and Marathas helped the Qutub Shahis, feel historians.
The Mughals were the common enemy of Marathas and the Qutub Shahis. Golconda Fort fell to Aurangzeb's army in 1687, seven years after the death of Chhatrapati Shivaji.

  <h1 class="d"><u> AFJAL KHAN KILLED BY SHIVAJI MAHARAJ </u></h1>
  <img   class="b e" src="./../images/afzal-killing.jpg"  >

  <P class="a ">

    In the meeting, Khan, in the guise of embracing him, attempted to stab the Maratha leader.
     But Shivaji was protected by his armour and retaliated: the wagh nakh ripped out Khan's guts.
      Khan would eventually be beheaded by one of Shivaji's men and in the battle that followed, Shivaji's army came out as victor.
      Shivaji himself was carrying a concealed weapon called the Wagh Nakh or the nails of the tiger. The weapon could be easily concealed in the palm of the hand.
       He tore open his belly with the weapon. His bodyguards neutralized the attack of Khan's bodyguards. 

      Afzal Khan was later beheaded for his treachery. 
      
      This is considered a massive Maratha victory as Shivaji, said to be of medium height, killed towering Afzal Khan in a battle of wits, nerves and valor. Khan was said to be over 7-feet-tall.
