            <p>(February 19, 1630 â€“April 3, 1680), popularly known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian king
                and the
                founder of the Maratha Empire.[1] Shivaraya carved out his own independent kingdom from the
                decaying Adilshahi of Bijapur and founded the Maratha Empire. A.D. He was formally enthroned as
                Chhatrapati in 1674 at Raigad Fort <br>
                <br>During his reign, Shivaji Maharaj had both alliances and enmity with the Mughal Empire, the
                Qutub Shahi of Gowalkonda, the Adil Shahi of Bijapur and the European colonial powers.
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj built a powerful and progressive state on the strength of a
                disciplined army and a well-organized administrative system. Besides repairing the forts in the
                coastal and interior regions, he also built many new forts. Shivarai established a competent and
                progressive civil government with disciplined administrative organizations. He revived the
                ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions. <br><br>
                With his excellent knowledge of the terrain, amazing speed of movement and the technique of
                guerilla poetry, he successfully fought the mighty Mughal and Adil Shahi forces with a small
                force. He encouraged the use of Marathi and Sanskrit instead of Parsi, which was the prevailing
                language of the time, in governance. During the Indian freedom struggle, nationalist leaders
                used Shivaji Maharaj's heroic stories to rally people and boost their morale. <br><br>Shivaji
                Maharaj's legacy varied with observers and time. But nearly two centuries after his death, he
                began to gain more prominence with the rise of the Indian independence movement as many Indian
                freedom fighters considered him a proto-nationalist and Hindu hero. Shivaji Maharaj has a great
                influence in the social and political history of Maharashtra. Shivaji Maharaj is an integral
                part of the Marathi people's identity.[6] Shivaji Maharaj's birthday is celebrated as Shiv
                Jayanti.[7]

            Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti or Shiva Jayanti is a famous festival and
            celebration in Maharashtra . This festival is celebrated all over Maharashtra on February 19 as
            fixed by the Maharashtra government on the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the
            founder of the Maratha Empire . This day is a public holiday in Maharashtra . [1] This festival
            is also celebrated on a small scale in some places outside Maharashtra. <br><br>
            <b> History:</b><br>
            Beginning of Shiva Jayanti: In 1869, Mahatma Phule discovered Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's
            mausoleum at Raigad and wrote the first long poem on his life. Jyotiba had applied that the
            government should take over the arrangement of Shivaji Maharaj's mausoleum at Raigad. In 1870,
            Mahatma Phule celebrated the first "Shiva Jayanti" in Pune. Then in 1895, Lokmanya Tilak started
            Shiv Jayanti celebrations. The intention behind this was that the people should come together on
            the occasion of such festivals to arouse patriotism and use it to fight against the British. In
            the early days, Shiv Jayanti was celebrated only in Maharashtra. But in the first decade of the
            20th century, the festival of Shiva Jayanti reached Bengal. <br><br>
            Lokmanya Tilak initiated the celebration of Shiv Jayanti and started celebrating Shiv Jayanti
            vigorously in entire Maharashtra. It was necessary for the youth to unite against the British
            and to become nationalistic, for which Tilak celebrated Shiv Jayanti every year with great
            fanfare, a tradition that continues even today. In the 20th century, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar also
            celebrated Shiv Jayanti, he presided over the Shiv Jayanti program twice. Since then, Shiv
            Jayanti began to be celebrated on a large scale. On 3rd May 1927 at Badlapur near Mumbai , Dr.
            Shiv Jayanti Utsav. It was celebrated under the presidency of Babasaheb Ambedkar.The
            villagers of Badlapur had invited Babasaheb Ambedkar for the program without caste
            discrimination. <br><br> <br></div>
